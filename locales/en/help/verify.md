Link ROBLOX and Discord accounts together through this command (must be enabled web panel). When running this command for the first time, you get a code to put in your status or description. When ran again, it will link the two accounts and grant a role of your choosing. Optionally, it can set the user's nickname to their ROBLOX name. Using this, people can sync their roles in a group to their roles in discord.
